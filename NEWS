## USAboundaries 0.2.0

-  Added contemporary boundaries for states, counties, congressional districts, and zipcodes from the U.S. Census Bureau.
-  Import many fewer packages.
-  The `us_boundaries()` function no longer has an option to return a fortified data frame. It is assumed that users will convert the `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` objects to whatever format they need.
-  All data is now contained in the USAboundariesData package.

-  Fix to README.md as requested by CRAN.

## USAboundaries 0.1
